# Namaste React Course Repository

Welcome to my Namaste React course repository. This repository is dedicated to storing my notes and code from each session of the Namaste React course by Akshay Saini. As a student of the course, I'll be documenting my learning journey here.

## Course Details

- **Title:** Namaste React
- **Instructor:** Akshay Saini

## Notes and Code

In this repository, you will find folders for each session of the course. I'll be organizing my notes and code for each session in a structured manner. Here's how I plan to do it:

- For each session, I'll create a new folder with a meaningful name, like `session-1`, `session-2`, and so on.

- Inside each session folder, I'll store my notes in Markdown format, documenting the key concepts covered, important code snippets, and any challenges I faced during the session.

- Alongside the notes, I'll save the code examples and projects we work on during the session. This will help me keep track of my progress and refer back to the code whenever needed.

Each session folder will contain session-specific notes and code examples.
